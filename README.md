OOPS TASK:

Telugu Stream App - Python Streaming Platform

This Python task simulates a streaming platform with user registration, login, and subscription management.  

Users can browse a catalog of movies and series, watch content, and view their watch history with timestamps.  

The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and method overriding.  


It features an interactive console menu system for easy navigation and operation.  

To run: Execute `python telugustream.py` in the project directory.  

This task helps build foundational skills in designing console applications and modeling real-world systems.  

Future improvements include GUI integration, persistent data storage, and enhanced error handling.  

This project is for educational and learning purposes.  

Thank you for viewing my work!
